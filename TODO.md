- clean events.jsx

- different format function must be used to format dbData

- date must somehow take into consideration not only start time, but events that already started too, even if we don't the duration

- filter events in a file

- "tag" must be converted into "word", and word must include : tag, name, location

- fetch data in Home Page, so the data lands in a Context and is available as soon as the user lands in event page

b) UI polish
