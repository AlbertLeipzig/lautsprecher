- date must somehow take into consideration not only start time, but events that already started too, even if we don't have the duration

- fetched data in a Context and is available as soon as the user lands in event page

- fetched data must be PROPERLY stored

- what happens if there's no answer from database? implement a message

b) UI polish

- event card component
