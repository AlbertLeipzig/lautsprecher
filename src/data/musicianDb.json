            "description" : "John Winston Ono Lennon, MBE was an English singer, songwriter, and peace activist who co-founded the Beatles, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in the history of popular music. With Paul McCartney, he formed a songwriting partnership that is the most celebrated of the 20th century. He and McCartney remain the most successful songwriting team in history. After the group disbanded in 1970, Lennon embarked on a solo career that produced 17 number-one singles on the UK Singles Chart and 11 number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100. In 2002, a BBC poll on the 100 Greatest Britons voted him eighth and, in 2008, Rolling Stone ranked him the fifth-greatest singer of all time. In 1980, Lennon was murdered in New York City by Mark David Chapman.",
